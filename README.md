# glass power level

	Ok, Glass: What is his power level?
	Glass: It's over 9000!

This is an example application I put together to play around with the native GDK for Google Glass. It does nothing particularly useful, but I suppose it makes a nice gag joke, right?

Feel free to use it as a base point for understanding how to use the GDK, Gradle, etc.

## Shameless plug

I develop Glass stuff. Follow me on [Github](https://github.com/jaxbot) for more goodies, or check out my site [OkaySass](http://okaysass.com/).
